# AccoMontage2

### Introduction

AccoMontage2 is a system capable of doing full-length song harmonization and accompaniment arrangement based on a lead melody. Based on [AccoMontage](https://github.com/zhaojw1998/accomontage), AccoMontage2 invents a harmonization module to generated chord progression, and provides a [GUI](https://billyyi.top/accomontage2/) to control the generating styles of chords and textures. Our paper *[AccoMontage2: A Complete Harmonization and Accompaniment Arrangement System](https://arxiv.org/abs/2209.00353)* is accepted by [ISMIR 2022](https://ismir2022.ismir.net/). This repository stores the code corresponding to the paper.

### Binary Data Files Download

You might have to download some data files and store them in `chorderator/static` before running. You can find them [here](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1z8oW16dZtdS06woHc7_rxserNJRrkc4s?usp=sharing).

### Dataset Download

If you want to explore our dataset or use it for your own project, you can find it [here](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1OxM_wjcDyprrDzXSEy7AAJ2v8E04TQAI?usp=sharing) (For those who don't have access to Google, you can use the mirror at [Baidu Netdisk](https://pan.baidu.com/s/15SAUUbwma7nva0y70IcSnw?pwd=k2iy)). Note that you don't need to download them if you only want to run AccoMontage2.

The dataset is re-organized from the original [Niko Dataset](https://www.pianoforproducers.com/nikos-ultimate-midi-pack/). It contains 5k+ chord progressions with style labels. We provide our dataset in two formats:

1. MIDI: each chord progression piece stored as a single MIDI file.
2. Quantized Note Matrix: a python dictionary with format like the following. `nmat`is an 2-d matrix, each row represent a quantized note: `[start, end, pitch, velocity]`. <u>Each note is quantized at the eighth note level. eg., `start=2` means the note begins at the third eighth note.</u> `root` is also an 2-d matrix. It labels the roots of the chords using an eighth note sample rate. Each row of the `root` represents a bar. Each element is an integer ranged from 0 (C note) to 11 (B note).

```python
{'piece name': 
 	{'nmat': [[0, 3, 60, 60], ...],    # 2-d matrix: note matrix
     'root': [[0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0], ...], # 2-d matrix: root label
     'style': 'some style',            # pop_standard, pop_complex, dark, r&b, unknown
     'mode': 'some mode',              # M, m
     'tonic': 'C'                      # C, Db, ..., B
    }, 
 ...
}

# load the dataset using pickle
import pickle
with open('dataset_path_and_name.pkl', 'rb') as file:
    dataset = pickle.load(file)
```

### Interfaces and Demo

##### Run with terminal

A demo is provided. If you want to run demo, please check all the requirements in ``requirments.txt`` are satisfied, and run

```
python demo.py
```

This demo takes in the melody midi file `hpps65` and output the result in folder `hpps65_output_results`.

```python
# demo.py

import chorderator as cdt

if __name__ == '__main__':
    
    demo_name = 'hpps65'
    input_melody_path = 'MIDI demos/inputs/' + demo_name + '/melody.mid'

    cdt.set_melody(input_melody_path)
    cdt.set_meta(tonic=cdt.Key.G)
    cdt.set_segmentation('A8B8A8B8')
    cdt.set_texture_prefilter((0, 2))
    cdt.set_note_shift(0)
    cdt.set_output_style(cdt.Style.POP_STANDARD)
    cdt.generate_save(demo_name + '_output_results')
```

Interfaces are provided as follows:

| Method Name             | Description                                                  | Mandatory before generating                                  | Usage Example                                            |
| ----------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------ | ------------------------------------------------------------ | -------------------------------------------------------- |
| `set_melody`            | The input melody path                                        | True                                                         | `set_melody('input.mid')`                                |
| `set_meta`              | Assign tonic (mandatory), mode (default major), and meter (default 4/4, and currently only 4/4 is supported) to the melody | True                                                         | `set_meta(tonic=cdt.Key.A, mode=cdt.Mode.MAJOR)`         |
| `set_segmentation`      | A string to represent the phrase information of the melody. Should be in form 'phrase_name+phrase_length'*n. For example, `A8A8B8B8`. Phrase length only support 4-bars and 8-bars. | True                                                         | `set_segmentation('A8A8B8B8')`                           |
| `set_texture_prefilter` | A tuple (a, b) controlling the style of the textures. a, b can be integers in [0, 4], each controlling horizontal rhythmic density and vertical voice number. The higher number, the denser rhythms. For more information, please refer to [AccoMontage](https://github.com/zhaojw1998/AccoMontage). | False, texture might be in any style if not assigned         | `set_texture_prefilter((2,2))`                           |
| `set_note_shift`        | If there is a piece of blank at the beginning of the melody that you don't want to start generating, please specify the length of the blank with the number of 16-th note. | False, default 0                                             | `set_note_shift(16)`                                     |
| `set_output_style`      | A string to control the chord progression style. Currently, four styles are available: `'pop_standard'`, `'pop_complex'`, `'r&b'`, `'dark'`. | False, chord progression might be in any style if not assigned | `set_output_style(cdt.Style.POP_STANDARD)`               |
| `generate_save`         | Start generating with the specified parameters. A string must be passed in to specify the output folder. By default, the program will output three files: `chord_gen.mid`: a melody track and a chord progression track; `chord_gen.json`: generate log of the harmonization module; `textured_chord_gen.mid`: a melody track and a accompaniment track. Three more parameters are available for this method. `task`: what to output and from where to generate, for example, `task='textured_chord'` will make the program only output the `textured_chord_gen.mid`; `log`: whether to output the log file; `wav`: whether to generate a .wav file for the generating result. If you want to generate a .wav file, please make sure you have [midi2audio](https://pypi.org/project/midi2audio/) and [FulidSynth](https://www.fluidsynth.org/) installed. | -                                                            | `generate_save('generate_result', log=False, wav=False)` |

More detailed controllability is provided. Please refer to the `Core` Class in `chorderator/core.py`. A core object can be instantiated by calling `cdt.get_chorderator()`.
